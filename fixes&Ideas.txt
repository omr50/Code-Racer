- add red for incorrect space (enter or any other character instead of space)
  for now it just goes unnoticed

- make the box only fit the code

- some way to make the code snippets have color like a code editor

- cursor should blink to allow you to see the character or at least be a bit opaque

- allow user to type if focused in the whole page, not specific element, or inform them they aren't focused

- when going to new game reset timer to 0 even before they type

- if there's an error best to make everything after it red so user knows to go back to it

- make html not have red text/green text, or make the (correct/incorrect) lighting better
- features:
  - account
  - if no account save to local storage
  - wpm from each game saved to construct chart along with date / time
      - total words typed in lifetime
      - the total mistakes per game chart
      - filter per languagea

  - add the enter emoji again when about to enter

  - tabs in the code snippet should have an emoji for it 
  - tabs currently exit you out of the code snippet box and messes up the time.
  
  - possibly allow users to submit errors (get back the id of the actual one that caused the error and persist it)
