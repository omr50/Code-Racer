- leaderboard 
  - all time
  - most recent ("updating", in mem top 100 or in redis)
    - for now i think in mem is fine (concurrent access data structure)

- make html not have red text/green text, or make the (correct/incorrect) lighting better
- if no account save to local storage
  - add the enter emoji again when about to enter


  

- zero mistake mode & other modes:
  - currently have zero mistakes mode
  - add other modes
    - mistakes allowed mode
    - exit game if mistake mode? (PERFECT MODE)
    - flash mode? code disappears (memory mode?)

- local storage caching of games played and wpm charts
  - prevent excess calls to the DB

- possibly allow users to submit errors (get back the id of the actual one that caused the error and persist it)


Completed:

- when going to new game reset timer to 0 even before they type

- do a "create account to see your improvement: stats like wpm, accuracy, mistakes chart & game history"

- change the red / wrong color to be stronger for now it just not as tough, the red for background and for color 

- cursor should blink to allow you to see the character or at least be a bit opaque

- make the box only fit the code

- some way to make the code snippets have color like a code editor

- allow user to type if focused in the whole page, not specific element, or inform them they aren't focused

- if there's an error best to make everything after it red so user knows to go back to it

- im thinking tabs can just be auto skipped for consistency
  - this is probably the best case, since users will be used to not using it for most of the snippets

- deal with expired token issues 
  - user should probably get another token from server 
  - or get logged out 
  - or server should refresh their token on their request

- tabs currently exit you out of the code snippet box and messes up the time.

- account
  - wpm from each game saved to construct chart along with date / time
      - total words typed in lifetime
      - the total mistakes per game chart
      - filter per languagea
